This repository includes some simple projects I have had the momentum to get into nice enough shape to share with other
people while learning about neural networks and machine learning. So far it includes two projects, both of which I will
hopefully still improve. More will be coming soon(ish).

I have attempted to write the projects with some concern to readibility and "niceness" of the code (although documentation
and comments might be lacking in some cases), which hopefully makes them accessible to whoever wishes to study them.

## The list of projects in this repository:

* **kaggle-seedlings**: My code for the plant seedlings image classification challenge from Kaggle. It as a result of me learning how to use the Keras library for image classification tasks.

* **w2v**: My code for finding vector embeddings for words using the skip-gram algorithm. Inspired by Udacity's Deep Learning course exercise, but greatly enhanced to allow usage for a wider variety of learning tasks. Also a result of me learning to write code in pure TensorFlow.
