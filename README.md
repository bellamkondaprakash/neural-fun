This repository includes some simple projects I have (sort of) completed while learning about neural networks. So far
it includes only one project, but I plan to add more later when I get around to making more of my codes somewhat completed
and polished.

## The list of projects in this repository:

* **kaggle-seedlings**: My code for the plant seedlings image classification challenge from Kaggle. It as a result of me learning how to use the Keras library for image classification tasks.

* **w2v**: My code for finding vector embeddings for words using the skip-gram algorithm. Inspired by Udacity's Deep Learning course exercise, but greatly enhanced to allow usage for a wider variety of learning tasks. Also a result of me learning to write code in pure TensorFlow.
